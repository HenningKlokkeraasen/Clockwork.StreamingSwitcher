# Clockwork.StreamingSwitcher
An application to make switching between music streaming providers painless

## Terminology

* Music Streaming Provider (MSP): A service you can subscribe to for streaming music e.g. Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music
* Music Streaming Service (MSS) = MSP
* MSP data: The music catalog and meta data provided by an MSP (e.g. albums, artists, tracks, playlists, editorial content)
* User data (your data): A user's (your) playlists and favorites/following in an MSP

## Goals

* Browse/Get an overview of your data in one or more MSPs
* Update/manage your data in one or more MSPs
* Backup/export your data from an MSP
* Move/migrate your data (playlists, favorites) from one MSP to another
* Keep your data synced between MSPs
* Compare what music is available in different MSPs
* See what music is available compared to digital music stores (e.g. iTunes Music, Amazon, Google Play)
* Compare how MSPs structure their data compared to one another and to meta data providers such as MusicBrainz, The Echno Nest
* Link data from MSPs to other music services such as AllMusic/Rovi, Discogs, Last.fm, SoundCloud, BandCamp, WhoSampled, Genius, Wikipedia and basically everything from https://www.acrcloud.com/blog/music-apis-the-list-of-2016
